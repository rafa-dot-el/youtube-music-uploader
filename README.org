* Listening
Using =mopidy= the plugin [[https://github.com/OzymandiasTheGreat/mopidy-ytmusic][mopidy-ytmusic]]

While Youtube Music introduced the limitations on their app to restrict it
running in background. A better player and alternative is to use [[https://f-droid.org/packages/it.vfsfitvnm.vimusic/][ViMusic]],
[[https://github.com/z-huang/InnerTune][InnerTune]] or [[https://github.com/KRTirtho/spotube][spotube.]] These players so far don't allow you to log into your
account and consume your own music.
